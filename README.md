# Computer Wars
Advance Wars engine built primarily for the Windows platform.
If you've somehow stumbled across this project, then please stick around. This is one of my active projects as of right now, and I hope to keep working on it for the coming few years.

### Planned Features
- Customisable Advance Wars engine: countries, graphics, units, terrains, COs, etc. will all be customisable, as well as a lot more.
- The ability to not only modify the game using scripts, but also the ability to modify the engine itself.
- Internet play.
- Campaign engine.
- Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, and hopefully Linux (I will decouple the code from MSVC++ 2019 before I make the first full release).
- Controllable via mouse, keyboard, or gamepad/joystick.
- Ability to easily add in Artificial Intelligence after-the-fact (actually implementing the AI is not a main goal, but it will be invaluable for the campaign side of the engine).
- In-depth documentation, along with tutorials and examples once the project is ready for release.

### June 5th 2021
The project has now entered the alpha stage :smile:! [Here's a small demo](https://youtu.be/p96ly3l8YBo) of the project so far. Not much, true, but development should be fairly rapid once I find more time to dedicate to the project in the near future. The engine can load basic maps and display/animate them, but not much else yet. It's far from a complete product, so if you really want an Advance Wars engine **now**, then you can check out [Robosturm's project](https://github.com/Robosturm/Commander_Wars): it might be one of the only AW engine out there of this flavour that's still being actively developed, so go check it out. [This project by ThislsAUsername](https://github.com/ThislsAUsername/DefendPeace) is also worth mentioning. [Custom Wars Tactics](https://github.com/ctomni231/cwtactics) is a web-based Advance Wars engine that you should check out, too :smile:!
