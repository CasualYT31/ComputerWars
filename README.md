# Computer Wars
Advance Wars engine built primarily for the Windows platform.

### Planned Features
- Customisable Advance Wars engine: countries, graphics, units, terrains, COs, etc. will all be customisable, as well as a lot more.
- The ability to not only modify the game using scripts, but also the ability to modify the engine itself.
- Internet play.
- Campaign engine.
- Eventually cross-platform: Windows, macOS, and hopefully Linux (I will have to decouple the code from MSVC++).
- Controllable via mouse, keyboard, or gamepad/joystick.
- Ability to easily add in Artificial Intelligence after-the-fact (actually implementing the AI is not a main goal, but it will be invaluable for the campaign side of the engine).
- In-depth documentation, along with tutorials and examples once the project is ready for release.

### Introduction
If you've somehow stumbled across this project, then please stick around. This is one of my active projects as of right now, and I hope to keep working on it for the coming months/few years.

This project is very much in the pre-pre-alpha stage right now, as I've only been working on this version of the engine since December 2019. I don't have any working product to show yet. However, a lot of the ground work has been covered (rendering, audio, user input, logging, internationalisation, etc.), and I am making a lot of progress beyond this ground work.

If you really want an Advance Wars engine **now**, then you can check out [Robosturm's project](https://github.com/Robosturm/Commander_Wars): it might be the only AW engine out there of this flavour that's still be actively developed, so go check it out. [This project by ThislsAUsername](https://github.com/ThislsAUsername/DefendPeace) is also worth mentioning.
